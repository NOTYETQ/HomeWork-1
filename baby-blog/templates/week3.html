    <h1>Week 3 - Self-Assessment & Git</h1>
    <p>This week, we continued with handlers and went more into depth about how they worked. we also
    had a self-assessment that involved creating a file directory, setting up Git, 
    writing a simple Go program and some handlers for our webserver, and pushing it to GitHub.
    This was done to test everything that we had learned so far in class</p>
    
    <h2>Setting up a Repository</h2>
    <p>We initialized a Git repository, created a simple web server in Go, and pushed it to GitHub.</p>
    
    <pre><code>// Initializing a new Git repository
package main

    import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
)


func feature(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.Write([]byte("HelllllllllOOOOO"))

}

func main() {

	mux :=http.NewServeMux()

	mux.HandleFunc("/", feature)

	err := http.ListenAndServe(":4000", mux)

    log.Fatal(err)

	fmt.Println("Hello World")

$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ gti checkout -b intro-feature
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "feature"
$ gti checkout main
$ gti merge feature
$ gti branch -d feature
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/NOTYETQ/go-basics-1.git
$ git push -u origin main</code></pre>

<p>
    Above is the simple code we had to create show to what we had learned in class during those weeks.
    The git commands that were used are also above. I had forgotten about those commands so the assignment
    was very helpful in making me remember and get used to them again.
